Scans indicate a small, low energy station held in a system lagrange point. 

The Succotash has picked up vehicles coming every day or two and then leaving lighter. Once, the Succotashes records show a single ship leaving the planet and docking at the station. This ship hasn't left the station.

Scans have shown that the station shows distressing amounts of power fluctuations. With a very large error margin, The Succotash shows that for a few milliseconds the station even vibrated at a low frequency.
