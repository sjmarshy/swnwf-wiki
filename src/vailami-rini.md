# Vailami Rini

*A planet in the [Halane](./system-halane.md) system*

Vailami Rini is a green, temperate planet with a healthy cloud coverage. The biosphere is incompatible with humans.

The Succotash has determined from monitoring the planet that the capitol city is Adramyttion, and the planet seems to be home to something called the 'Aquillean Empire' - the little bits of news the Succotash has picked up from the planet mention this empire and it's leader, 'Fabius', very regularly.

Administrator *Amabere Okoye* seems to be in charge of the planet at the moment.
